# Article-Summarizer
In this project I created an algorithm that successfully summarizes any Wikipedia article that you input. It uses word frequencies to determine the most important sentences. Try it for yourself. All you need to do is replace the link in the Python file with the link to the article of your choice. Enjoy!
